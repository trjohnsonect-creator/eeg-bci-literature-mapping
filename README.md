# eeg-bci-literature-mapping
Literature-driven research project examining advances in EEG signal processing and machine learning for brain-computer interfaces. Includes documented search methods, curated datasets, and research outputs supporting reproducible, ethical, and transparent neurotechnology research. 
Project Overview

This repository documents a collaborative research project investigating how advances in EEG signal processing and machine learning within brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) can enhance the accurate interpretation of motor intention for neuroprosthetic applications.

The work focused on synthesizing and analyzing the existing scientific literature to identify methodological trends, research gaps, and future directions in EEG-based neuroprosthetics. Outputs include a cleaned bibliometric dataset and a scientific poster presentation developed for academic dissemination.

This repository is shared to demonstrate research methodology, data preparation, and analytical reasoning, in alignment with open and transparent research practices.

Research Question
How can advances in EEG signal processing utilizing machine learning within BCIs enhance the accuracy of interpreting motor intention for neuroprosthetic applications?

Keywords
Neuroprosthetics
EEG Signal Processing
Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCIs)
Motor Intention
Machine Learning
Bibliometric Analysis

Data Source and Methods
Literature data were collected using Web of Science (WoS) following a structured search strategy focused on EEG, BCIs, motor intention, and neuroprosthetic systems.
Records were exported and cleaned, standardized, and curated to support downstream analysis.
The cleaned dataset was used to support bibliometric summaries and thematic analysis informing the poster presentation.
While the original statistical and visualization scripts are not included, this repository preserves the processed research artifacts and documents the analytical workflow used.

My Contribution
I personally contributed to the project through the following activities:
Designing and executing the Web of Science literature search strategy
Cleaning and structuring bibliometric data for analysis (deduplication, variable standardization, and formatting)
Preparing datasets suitable for quantitative and visual analysis
Contributing to the conceptual framing, results interpretation, and poster development
Supporting synthesis of findings related to EEG signal processing and machine learning trends in neuroprosthetics

This repository reflects my individual research contributions within a collaborative academic project.
